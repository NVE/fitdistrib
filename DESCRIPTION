Description: This package was developed for the FlomKart project.
  It contains functions to fit probability distributions to flood data.
  The following distributions are implemented:
  - Generalized extreme value (gev)
  - Generalized logistics (gl)
  - Gumbel (gumbel)
  - Gamma (gamma)
  - Pearson III (pearson)
  Four parameter estimation methods are available:
  - Maximum likelihood (mle)
  - Linear moments (Lmom)
  - Ordinary moments (mom)
  - Bayesian inference (bayes)
  All functions are named distr_method (i.e. gl_bayes)
